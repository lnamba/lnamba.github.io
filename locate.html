<!-- Case Project Week 4 Code Explanation: Exception Handling
  The form I chose to use JS exception handling was on my locate.html file. 
I wanted to check for errors and notify the user with alert messages. 
I used a few of the different debugging methods from Chapter 4 including:
commenting out code (a personal favorite of mine); try throw and catch statements; and browser 
debugging tools. 
  I happened to have a difficult time on this chapter, mostly becuase I was 
completely unfamiliar with the topic. When I tested code with comments, I 
would try one bit of code, find that it worked somewhat and then comment it 
out and rebuild it with tweaks that I hoped would change the functionality in some way. 
  The try, throw and catch statements were new to me. It made sense when I read the chapter, but 
implementing it was another story. I did need to ask for help on understanding how 
to put the statements into practice. With a lot of testing, I managed to complete  
a try statement to check if the field was blank. If it was, I had it throw an error
message telling the user to enter a valid state. 
  I also created another try statement to check if the value of the user's input 
matched one of the values from my getDistrict() function, which locates the 
nearest district to any US state. If it did not match any of the states in my switch 
statement, it throws an error notifying the user that there is no such location found.
  As I was reading the chapter, I had a hard time understanding how to use the debugger
debugger tools in Chrome, even while walking through the tractor.htm/tuba.js activity 
in the book. I decided to try it out with my code for practice and thought it was so 
interesting how using the "step in" button, you can literally see every step of the 
code that you wrote. I set a breakpoint at a part of the second try block and liked 
watching as it checked the value of my if statement (in my try block) to the value that 
was returned from another function. While I didn't understand it before, I have a better 
grasp of how it can help you as a developer now. Actually before, I didn't know that the 
debugging tools existed as part of the browser's developer tools.
