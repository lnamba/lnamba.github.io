        <h3>JACL History</h3>
        <p>Founded in 1929, the JACL is the oldest and largest Asian American civil rights organization in the United States. The JACL monitors and responds to issues that enhance or threaten the civil and human rights of all Americans and implements strategies to effect positive social change, particularly to the Asian Pacific American community.</p>
        <h3>JACL Arizona Chapter</h3>
        <p>Growing from a small community gathering hall, to one of the strongest Asian
        American organizations in Arizona, the Arizona Chapter of the Japanese American
        Citizens League (JACL) has served as a source of social change and community activism
        for over 75 years. Officially founded in 1934, the JACL Arizona Chapter now boasts more
        than 300 diverse members, from Nisei to Gosei (2nd- to 5th-generation Japanese
        Americans) and a variety of ethnic backgrounds. The Nisei have served as the core
        leaders of the Arizona Chapter, ensuring both its growth and its success. </p>
        <p>Today, the Chapter hosts a variety of activities for its members and its community including: an annual picnic, community service projects, and educational activities, such as teacher workshops on the Japanese American internment experience. There are also annual and monthly events such as: the Sara Hutchings Clardy Scholarship Awards preseted to youth members, a summer bowling league and cooking and craft events. The JACL Arizona Chapter will continue to develop as a dynamic organization rooted in strong history and committed to the future. </p>
